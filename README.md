# MHW-SimpleSearch

Windows desktop application to search for armor sets in the upcoming game Monster Hunter: World. Currently works from an unfinished set of data that was obtained from the temporary PS4 beta. Not all intended features are implmemented or completely working, until the release of the game. Completion will be delayed by up to one month after release, so that everyone can enjoy what the game has to offer :)

Not implemented in the current build:
1. Charms/Talismans
2. Decorations
3. Full list of skills/armor
4. Exporting results

I would like to thank Capcom and the various Monster Hunter development teams for consistently delivering spectacular games across different platforms!
